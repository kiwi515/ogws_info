/**
 * @brief Disc file loaded into RAM
 * @details Similar to EGG's DvdFile structure,
 * except this class expects the file's data to already have been loaded into RAM.
 * 
 * Paths are relative to the project root (i.e. `"Common/Kokeshi/common.carc"`)
 * 
 * In theory this class could be used for all open files, but the resource manager
 * seems to only use it for archives post-decompression.
 * Perhaps it "simulates" the existence of data only in memory as a file?
 * 
 * This class has an additional ut::Node so that the resource manager can keep track of all open files.
 * It removes itself from the resource manager's file list (at 0x10) on destruction.
